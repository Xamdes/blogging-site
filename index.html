      <p>Today we are learning how to style html using classes, divs and spans.
      Spanning lets me do stuf like <span class="span_red"> red </span>,
      <span class="span_blue">blue</span> and <span class="span_green">green</span>,
      Although not to be confused with spam which is irrelevent. Just need to enclose
      whatever text we want to affect with &ltspan class="span_blue"&gt<span
      class="span_blue">blue</span>&lt/span&gt</p>
    </div>
    <div class="">

    </div>
    <p>Next up are divs which are also fun to use.</p>
